About:

cricket team SQL project is a comprehensive database system designed to manage and organize information about our team, including players, matches, and statistics. We have recently added a new entity to our database: the Sponsor. Sponsors are individuals or organizations that provide financial support to our team. Each sponsor has a unique ID, name, office address, and type. This new addition allows us to keep track of our sponsors and their contributions to our team. With this information at our fingertips, we can better manage our finances and build stronger relationships with our supporters.
