ABOUT:
cricket team SQL project is a comprehensive database system designed to manage and organize information about our team, including players, matches, and statistics. We have recently added a new entity to our database: The Sponsor. Sponsors are individuals or organizations that provide financial support to our team. Each sponsor has a unique ID, name, office address, and type. This new addition allows us to keep track of our sponsors and their contributions to our team. With this information at our fingertips, we can better manage our finances and build stronger relationships with our supporters.

Official Partners: These are companies that have an official partnership with a team or event and provide financial support in exchange for branding and advertising opportunities. For example, Dream11, Unacademy, CRED, Upstox, RuPay and Swiggy Instamart are official partners of IPL 2022.


Broadcasters: These are media companies that have the rights to broadcast matches and events. For example, Star Sports is the official broadcaster of IPL 2022.


Kit Sponsor: This is a company that provides the team's uniforms and has their logo displayed on them. For example, Adidas is the kit sponsor for the Indian national menâ€™s cricket team.
