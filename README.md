# player-mental-fitness-management-project
ABOUT:
This  project is a comprehensive database system designed to manage and organize information about the team, including players, matches, and statistics. We have added a new entity to our database: The Sponsor. Sponsors are individuals or organizations that provide financial support to the team. Each sponsor has a unique ID, name, office address, and type. This new addition allows us to keep track of the sponsors and their contributions to the team. With this information at our fingertips, we can better manage our finances and build stronger relationships with our supporters.

phsycometric score for players:

In modern sports, the holistic development of athletes is paramount, and this includes both physical and mental fitness. Players undergo rigorous fitness testing to assess their endurance, strength, agility, and overall physical condition, ensuring they are in peak form to perform at their best. Alongside this physical preparation, each team now also has a dedicated mental conditioning coach. These coaches play a crucial role in enhancing players' psychological resilience, focus, and mental toughness, which are essential for success in high-pressure environments. By integrating both physical fitness and mental conditioning, teams strive to create well-rounded athletes who can excel both on and off the field.


In professional cricket, the mental state of each player can significantly impact their performance, and it is understood that these states may vary before every match. To address this, the following approach is proposed:

1. Pre-Match Psychometric Testing: Each player will undergo a psychometric test before every match to assess their mental readiness.
  
2. Scoring System: Players will receive a score based on their performance in these tests. The score will serve as an indicator of their match readiness.

3. Indicator, Not Determinant: It's essential to clarify that the psychometric score will be an indicator of a player's mental state and match readiness, not a determinant of their selection in the team.

4. Mental Fitness Sessions: Players who score below a certain threshold will be required to participate in mental fitness sessions to enhance their overall readiness and performance.

This approach ensures that all players are both physically and mentally prepared, fostering a balanced and effective team performance.



Model Selection:
Pre-trained NLP Model:
Use a pre-trained transformer-based language model like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or RoBERTa. These models are effective at understanding the context and nuances in natural language responses.


Regression/Classification Layer:
Depending on how you want to score the player's mental fitness, you can add a regression layer (if the score is continuous) or a classification layer (if the score is categorical, e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low").


2. Training Process:
Data Collection:Gather a dataset of sample questions, player responses, and corresponding mental fitness scores (labeled by experts).


Feature Extraction:
Feed the responses into the pre-trained NLP model to extract contextual embeddings.


Model Training:
Train a regression model using these embeddings as input to predict the mental fitness score.
If the scores are categorical, a classification model can be used.


4. Example Problem:
Input: Player answers to a set of psychological or mental conditioning questions.
Output: A predicted mental fitness score (e.g., 0-100 or categorical labels like "Ready," "Needs Improvement," etc.).


6. Implementation Considerations:
Data Quality: Ensure the dataset is diverse and covers a wide range of possible responses.
Interpretability: Incorporate SHAP values or attention mechanisms to provide insights into how specific responses influence the predicted score.
Customization: Tailor the model to sp
ecific sports by including sport-specific language and scenarios in the training data.


8. Model Flow:
Questionnaire → 2. Player Response → 3. NLP Model (BERT) → 4. Contextual Embeddings → 5. Regression/Classification Model → 6. Predicted Mental Fitness Score


Example:
Question: "How do you feel about your ability to focus under pressure?"
Player Response: "I feel confident, but sometimes I get distracted."
Model Output: Mental Fitness Score: 75 (on a scale of 0-100).
